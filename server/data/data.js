        missionStatement: "Bianchi is the most historic and prestigious brand of bicycles. Our heritage, over 130 years strong, started in Milan in 1885 with Edoardo Bianchi, cannot be equalled in the cycling world. Our positioning embodies the best of what Italy can offer to the world: a commitment to build products as artisans – “a regola d’arte”, distinguishing design, style and taste. Our wide-range of products fans out gradually to meet the needs of the professional and the casual rider, one who loves nature or one who simply wants to move quickly through urban traffic. We provide the ideal bicycle for every type of cyclist. Edoardo Bianchi said that the best way to test a product was to race it. That’s how the Reparto Corse or Racing Department was born. You can always learn something from man’s extreme fatigue racing a bike. Bianchi has always been able to take full advantage from those sensations and feedback to improve and test every bike thoroughly. Just like in motor racing, we have always had a dedicated division following the riders to improve in competitions. Innovation, science and technology come together with man’s sensations. It is not a mystery that for over 100 years this dedication has allowed our champions to win and enabled Bianchi to deliver excellence.",
